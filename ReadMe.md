## Rubicon Movies

---

> This is an app that uses **_TheMovieDB_** API to display a list of movies/ TV shows.
> It has been created using React, **CRA** to be precise.
> In addition to using **React**, it also uses:

- [**React-Router-Dom**](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) – [in order for the user to be able to move around the app by showing different screens]
- [**Redux**](https://react-redux.js.org) – [to preserve the state of the user’s input inside of the search-bar]
- [**Jest**](https://jestjs.io) & [**React Testing Library**](https://testing-library.com/) – [for writing several ‘dummy’ tests]
- [**Materialize CSS**](https://materializecss.com/) – [for implementation of some basic styling]
- [**Moment JS**](https://momentjs.com/) – [for appropriate time/ date formatting]
